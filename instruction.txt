1.  Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:
    ———————————————
    int Add(string numbers)
    ———————————————
    The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum.
    for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs.
    (for an empty string it will return 0)

2.  Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.

3.  Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
        a.the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)

4.  Support different delimiters
        a. To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]". For example, "//;\n1;2" where the delimiter is ";" should return 3.

5.  Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed.
    If there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.
